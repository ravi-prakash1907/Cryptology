I hear my wh*te noise app cut off on my phone and my alarm slowly getting louder. I wait for the chiming bells to stop before I roll over and hit the screen. With a deep breath, I muster the energy to get out of bed and drag myself to the shower.
Another glorious day in the life of waiting tables. I stop myself from skipping to the shower I’m so excited at the prospect of being yelled at by angry customers again today. People are just cranky lately.
After my shower, I make myself a quick breakfast, even though it’s late afternoon. Working the late shift means I miss the normal breakfast time, but let’s be real. Bacon can be enjoyed any time of the day.
Once the dishes are done and washed, I grab my keys and my bag, locking the door on my way out. I live by myself. It’s maybe not the best neighborhood, but all my neighbors are really nice, and we keep an eye on each other. When I turn around after locking my door, I see Mr. Turner walking up the steps to his apartment across the hall from mine.
“Hello, Miss Sephie. Going anywhere exciting?” He’s slowly climbing the stairs, with his groceries in hand. It’s Thursday, after all. Mr. Turner always stops by the grocery store on his way home on Thursdays.
“Hi, Mr. Turner. On my way to work. How was your day? Have any excitement at the hotel today?”
“No, not today, but I’m thankful for boring days, if I’m being honest.”
Mr. Turner worked the door at the most expensive hotel downtown. He’s been the doorman for 32 years and knows every single influential person in the city as a result.
“Boring days give you more time to find my Mr. Perfect, right? I like boring days too,” I chuckle.
Mr. Turner laughs as he reaches his door and sets his groceries down to unlock it. “Don’t you worry, Miss Sephie, I’ll find you the perfect man one day. You deserve it.”
“I don’t know about that, but I’ll take all the help I can get. Have a great night, Mr. Turner. I’ll see you in the morning and as always, if you need anything, you call me.” I waved goodnight to him as he walked in his apartment.
My smile lingers as I jog down the steps to the parking lot. Having great neighbors really can make a huge difference in your living situation.
Once I pull into the restaurant’s parking lot, I find my normal parking space taken. I grumble to myself as I am forced to park farther away from the building now. I am nothing, if not a creature of habit. Not getting my normal parking space means this is going to be a rough night. Hooray for Thursdays.
When I step out of my car, I notice the storm cl*uds slowly rolling in. Inhaling deeply, I breathe in the sweet scent of incoming rain and relish the last moment of sanity before my shift starts. I can do this.
It’s not just any Thursday. It’s the last Thursday of the month, which means that all the crime bosses in the city meet at this restaurant to discuss “business.” They reserve the back room and request that I serve them each time. I don’t know if it’s because I’m quiet, keep my head down most of the time, or if it’s because I can remember what each boss likes and doesn’t like, but they always request me. They always give me a fantastic tip, so it makes having to wait on known criminals somewhat manageable. Their tips are single-handedly funding my savings account, which means I’ll be able to move out of my questionable neighborhood sooner, rather than later.
“Hey Sephie. Are you coming inside or are you just going to stand by your car with your eyes closed like a psycho all night?”
“Sh*t- up, Max. I’m coming, I’m coming,” I say as I run to catch up to him. Max is the bartender and has his own fan club of women that come to the restaurant solely to be served drinks by him. His drinks aren’t special. He’s even admitted to watering down their drinks most days. They just want to stare at him while he smiles at them as he serves them their Cosmopolitans.
Max is tall, muscular, but a slender muscular. He looked like he could play in the NBA, not the NFL. His d*rty blonde hair was shorter on the sides, but he was letting it grow longer on top. He said the women loved slightly longer hair these days, so he was conducting market research to see if longer hair got him more tips. Max had a boyish charm about him, but he knew how to use his emerald green eyes to get the ladies. One look from him and most women would swoon. I was apparently immune to that look. He tried it often on me, but I would laugh every time. He said I was good for his humility, if nothing else.
“Were you meditating just now? Do you need to find inner peace before the meeting tonight?” he teased as he opened the back door for me.
“I was trying to find the strength not to smack you, a-h*le,” I laughed as I walked into the kitchen.
“Oh. You wound me.”
“I’m positive you will be able to find a woman to nurse your wounds, in…approximately 30 minutes,” I say as I look at my watch to see how long we have before the bar opens. From Thursday to Sunday, the women flock to the bar to see Max.
“But none of them will ever have my heart the way you do, my little gingersnap,” he says as he stands in front of me, leans into me, and gently tucks a loose curl behind my ear. He adjusts my thick braid over my shoulder and pretends to adjust the collar on my shirt.
I stare deeply into his big green eyes, as his fingers linger on my neck. Then I immediately break character into a fit of laughter as he also breaks and starts laughing.
“Go to work, Max.”
The black SUVs start arriving around 8 pm. Max is completely swamped with single women vying for his attention at the bar but still takes the time to run back to the kitchen like he’s a 5-year-old and yells, “THEY’RE HERE” and then runs back to the bar. I shake my head, laughing at his antics, take a deep breath, and steady myself for the night ahead.
The six bosses each come to this meeting with at least 2-4 additional people. Some are bodyguards, some are their children, and some are underbosses. The bosses are all very respectful, as are the bodyguards and the underbosses. It’s the children that I loathe. Sons of mafia bosses have the biggest egos I’ve ever encountered and worse, they feel entitled to act however they please. They’re handsy, they’re rude, and they all think that I should be throwing myself at them, simply because of who their fathers are.
Luckily, they don’t come to every meeting, but they’ll definitely be here tonight. Apparently, this meeting is extra important as the main boss. the overlord? I don’t know what to call him. Lord King Boss? Feels right – the Lord King Boss – will be here tonight. He rarely makes appearances in public, so I’m a little at a loss as to what’s so important that he would show up tonight, but I’m sure I’ll get snippets throughout the night. Because I’m always the one that takes care of this meeting, I know more about the goings on in the city than I probably should. I keep that information to myself, of course. I’m not an id*ot.
</pre><h1><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></h1>
<h3>Sephie</h3>
<pre>
There is a steady stream of food to the back room throughout the night and the alcohol flows freely. I’ve gotten four smacks to my a*s in the first hour. All the boss’s eldest sons are there. Lucky me.
Around 9:30, two new bodyguards, who are quite possibly the biggest men I’ve ever seen, walk into the restaurant as I’m waiting for Max to fill my latest alcohol order. Walking in right behind them, I see a man I don’t recognize, but can’t see clearly as the lights are dim in the restaurant. He steps fully inside the door, and I can clearly see his face. He’s tall, surprisingly young for a Lord King Boss, dark hair, two-day old stubble that I find myself wondering what would feel like against my neck, and he turns to look my direction with the most piercing blue eyes I think I’ve ever seen. He catches me staring at him and a sly smirk comes across his face. Just then, Max steps up behind me and gently pushes my shoulder.
“Hey, you should go escort him to the back room. He might not know where to go. I’ll have your drinks ready when you get back.”
I take a sharp breath in, broken out of my daze, and practically stumble toward the men at the front door.
“Uh…hi, I’m guessing you’re here for the meeting?”
His intense gaze leaves my face to scan down my body briefly and discreetly, as he reaches down to adjust the cuffs of his shirt. He looks up again and nods once.
Okay, man of many words. This, I can handle.
“Please, follow me.”
He nods once more, and all five men follow me to the back. There were two more bodyguards behind him that I couldn’t see until the first two units stepped further into the restaurant.
Before I open the door to the back room, I turn around to face them, asking “may I take your drink orders, gentlemen?”
One of the first bodyguards says, “yes, water for all of us, please.” His very thick, very Russian accent is very apparent.
I was surprised by his answer, so I cocked my head to the side, letting a “different” slip out before I realized I had said anything. My cheeks immediately flushed as I realized I had said the quiet part out loud.
“I’m so sorry. I mean no disrespect,” I said as I stared at the floor and stepped to the side while opening the door for them.
The first two bodyguards entered the room first, scanned the entire room, then nodded. The blue-eyed Lord King Boss stepped up closer to me while his bodyguards were scanning, that sly smirk on his face once again, and leaned in close enough that I could smell his intoxicating cologne.
“None taken,” he whispered, his Russian accent detectable as he stepped in front of his bodyguards to the welcoming greetings of the entire room.
“What the f*c k is wrong with me,” I muttered to myself as I rushed back to the bar to get those drinks and to add five more waters to the order.
The mood in the room palpably changed after Mr. Lord King Boss joined the meeting. Everyone was very tense and very serious. What had happened while I was getting those drinks? I did a quick head count as I delivered each individual drink order. Ok, nobody died while I was away. This is a good sign.
I placed a refill of bourbon in front of one of the boss’s sons. Anthony, I think his name was. This was Anthony’s eleventh bourbon of the evening. Max knew better than to water down these drinks, so Anthony was getting the good stuff, at full strength. In layman’s terms, Anthony was drunk off his a*s .
No sooner had the glass hit the table and Anthony reached back and smacked my a*s with such force that I was thrown forward onto the table, giving the men across from Anthony a full view down my shirt. I caught myself on the table and pushed myself back upright, only to meet those steel blue eyes once again. Only this time he wasn’t smirking. Instead, his jaw was clenched.
I could feel my cheeks turning fully red as I apologized under my breath and quickly left the room. As soon as the door closed, I rushed through the kitchen and out the back door. Ugh, I hated the last Thursday of the month.
I walked to the dumpster and back a couple of times when I heard the kitchen door opening. One of the giant bodyguards came out first, quickly followed by the new guy. I stopped my pacing, not knowing how I was going to walk past him to get back to the restaurant.
He turned to his bodyguard, who handed him a cigarette and a lighter. Lazily putting the cigarette between his lips, he tilted his head down slightly as he cupped his hands around his face to light it. When the flame ignited, his face was illuminated, revealing that his blue eyes were focused on me. I was still frozen in the same spot, wondering how I was going to walk casually by this very powerful man back into the restaurant.
Oh, for f*c k’s sake, just do it. After all, you have a job to do, Sephie.
I took a deep breath and walked up to the back door. I kept my gaze down until just before I reached the two men, but quickly glanced up and gave them the best smile I could muster, before reaching for the door. Just as my hand was about to make contact with the door, he reached out and gently grabbed my wrist, causing me to look at him in fearful confusion.
He must’ve seen the fear in my eyes because he immediately let go and raised both of his hands.
“Hey, not gonna hurt you. I just want to ask you some questions,” he said. His blue eyes, now darker, were so intense that it felt like he might be looking into my soul.
“Um, sure. What can I help you with? Did you want to order some food? Can I get you more than water?”
He let out a small chuckle, as did his bodyguard. What was so funny about me doing my job?
“No. But thank you. You’re very good at your job, but I don’t allow my men to drink when they’re working, and I never touch alcohol.”
“Oh…okay. Um, what kind of questions?”
“How well do you know those men in the meeting?”
“Um, I mean, define well? I’m always the waitress that serves them when they have their meetings. I know the older men by name, as they’re here every time. The younger men I have a harder time remembering because they aren’t always here. The sons aren’t always here either…thankfully” I whispered, once again realizing too late that I had said it out loud instead of in my head. “I know them more by their drink and food orders than anything else. I can tell you exactly what they like and don’t like when it comes to food and alcohol, but in the interest of self-preservation, that’s all the information I divulge on those men.”
He smirked at me and asked, “are they always so rude to you?”
“The older men, never. They’re very respectful. Most of the underbosses too are very respectful unless they drink too much. I’m not sure if their bodyguards know how to speak, because now that I think about it, I’ve never heard them say a word. The sons, though? What you saw earlier is a normal occurrence. Especially when they’re all here. It’s like they try to outdo each other.”
He squinted his eyes slightly as he inhaled the smoke from his cigarette. Holding his breath for a second before turning his head to bl ow the smoke into the air, away from me, his eyes never leaving mine. Why did I feel like I could look in those eyes for hours and never get tired of it?
“Thank you, uhhh…I’m sorry. I didn’t catch your name?”
“Sephie.”
“Sephie? That’s an unusual name.”
“It’s short for Persephone. Most people have a hard time pronouncing it, so I just shortened it. Also, those who know are generally nervous once they find out I’m named after the Queen of the Underworld,” I said, looking down at my fidgeting hands. I really loved my name, but it did come with a weird history.
“Thank you, Persephone. You’ve been very insightful. I’m pleased to have met you tonight,” he said as he extended his hand to me.
I hesitantly placed my hand in his. He gently turned my hand over and brought it up to his lips. When his lips connected to the back of my hand, it was like fireworks went off in my stomach.
I tried not to be obvious about the sharp inhale I took as he kissed the back of my hand, so I said, “yes, you too…mister?” as I looked at him inquisitively.
“Adrik. You can call me Adrik.”
</pre><h1><b>CHAPTER THREE</b></h1>
<h3>Sephie</h3>
<pre>
After my short interlude outside, I returned to work and tried my best to act like nothing happened. Anthony had apparently been chastised while I was away because he kept his hands to himself. This was new. Did Mr. Lord King Boss Adrik threaten him after I first went outside? Anthony had never stopped his juvenile antics before tonight.
I think I like Mr. Lord King Boss Adrik.
Most of the men had finished with their meals but were still deep in discussions. The room was tense, to say the least. I was busy picking up empty plates and taking them back to the kitchen. I recruited Max to help me pick up plates, so I wouldn’t have to make so many trips. Just as he was about to enter the room, one of the bodyguards stopped him.
“Excuse me, sir. Only the lovely lady is allowed in the room,” he said with his giant hand on Max’s shoulder. Max wasn’t a small guy either. He obviously worked out regularly and was well over six foot tall, but he looked small next to that absolute unit of a bodyguard.
I looked back at Max and smiled. “It’s okay, Max. I’ll get them. Thank you for offering to help.”
I let out a sigh as I walked into the room. I glanced in Adrik’s direction, only to notice his blue eyes staring at me once again. I quickly tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear and made myself busy.
After depositing another round of di rty dishes in the kitchen sinks, I walked out the kitchen door on my way back to the meeting room. In the back hallway, between the kitchen and the back room, I was met by none other than Anthony. He was coming out of the restroom, completely drunk, and acting like he might fall at any moment. I tried to hurry past him, but he caught my arm and pulled me back to stand right in front of him.
“Please let go of my arm. I have work to do,” I said, trying to pull away from him. His vice-like grip on my arm only got tighter. Did bourbon give him some kind of superhuman strength? Seriously. How was his grip so strong?
“C’mon, you know you’d much rather go into the bathroom with me for a quickie,” he said as he leaned in to try to kiss me, pushing me up against the wall so I couldn’t easily get away from him. Ugh, his breath was horrendous and smelled like he’d drank the entire bar that night. Truthfully, he’d probably had half of it, at least. I turned my head to avoid his lips, which only served to pi ss him off. He said something in Italian, which I didn’t understand because of his slurring, but he grabbed my other arm, again with his vice-like grip. He stepped even closer to me, as if that was possible. I could feel his entire body pressed against mine. I could even feel that he was getting aroused at standing so close to me.
He didn’t say anything for a moment. He just scanned up and down my body, his breath getting quicker, his pupils dilating. He released one arm and reached up to my face. With the back of his hand, he lightly grazed my cheek. I turned my head, trying once again to get away from him. He sighed.
“Do you know who I am? Do you know how many girls would love to be in your position right now?”
“Then why don’t you go find one of them. I’ll gladly tag her in,” I said.
“You have a smart mo uth. I’ve always heard that redheads were firecrackers. Maybe someone needs to teach you a lesson.”
“No thanks. School really wasn’t my thing. I probably won’t pay attention if you try to teach me anything.” I was hoping to make him frustrated enough that he would move, and I could escape his grasp. Even if he lost a little focus, I was preparing to deck him and then I was going to make a break for it. I thought about screaming but didn’t want to cause a scene. The entire back room was armed with enough firepower that they could level the entire block if it came to it, so making a scene wasn’t my finest idea. I was also hoping someone would come out of the kitchen, but most of the staff had already left for the night, as it was a slow night in the front of the restaurant. Max was still at the bar, and he likely wouldn’t hear me anyway. I had to figure out how to get out of this mess on my own.
“There’s that smart mo uth again,” he said as he ran his hand up my arm and slowly wrapped it around my neck. “Do you know what I do to women that don’t know when to sh ut up?” he asked as his grip slowly tightened around my neck. My entire body tensed, and my eyes went wide. I knew what was about to happen.
I felt my air being slowly cut off. Well, shi.* I definitely didn’t expect this to happen tonight. With my one free arm, I tried hitting him, but he had pressed his body against mine so tightly that I couldn’t get any kind of leverage on him, so my fist was practically useless.
“That’s it. I like it when they struggle. I like it when they beg me to stop.”
Perhaps my smart mo uth wasn’t the attribute I thought it was. My mind was racing as I was trying to figure out how to get away from him when I heard the door to the back room open. Footsteps were approaching. No, multiple footsteps were approaching. One last feeble attempt to hit him and suddenly he wasn’t there anymore, and I was on the ground coughing and gasping for air.
I felt a hand on my shoulder and instantly panicked. I scooted away as quickly as I could.
“Whoa, whoa, Persephone. It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. You’re safe now.”
I raised my gaze and was met with those blue eyes once again. They were darker in this light, but showing nothing but concern, as he reached out to me one more time. This time, I didn’t move away. He put one arm around my shoulders, and I leaned into his chest. I realized I was crying. He gently stroked my hair and told me everything was going to be alright.
The next thing I knew, he hooked his other arm under my legs and picked me up, carrying me back to the kitchen. It was empty when we walked in. He walked over to one of the food prep tables and sat me down on the table.
Standing in front of me, he produced a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to me, his hands never leaving my thighs. I stared at his hands while I wiped the tears from my face and tried to compose myself.
I felt his hand, gently, under my chin. He raised my head and tilted it all the way back so he could look at my neck.
“You’re going to have a gnarly bruise tomorrow.”
“Perks of being a redhead. You can look at me hard enough and I’ll bruise.”
He chuckled softly and I let out a laugh as well. It might not be the healthiest coping mechanism, but humor made everything better for me. I’d endured some hard times and made it through because I never lost my sense of humor.
Adrik tenderly wrapped one of my loose curls around his finger, while he scanned my face, concern still in his eyes.
“Redheads have a special place in this world. Legend has it they stole the fires of He*ll and that they carry the mark of Cain.”
“It’s all true. I also steal souls, but only on the weekends. Work has been busy lately and I have a surplus of souls, with not enough storage space right now.”
A wide smile came across his face as he laughed. Good grief this man was handsome. I found myself smiling in response to his laughter and in that brief moment I had forgotten the events that led us to this moment.
“You are a unique woman, Persephone.”
“Yeah, that’s true too. Redheads are only 2% of the world’s population and of that 2%, only 2% have an eye color as unique as mine. So, basically, I’m a unicorn.”
I looked into his eyes as I was talking. His smile faded slightly and the intensity returned. He stared into my eyes long enough that I got nervous. I dropped my gaze and started fidgeting with my hands.
My body does this weird thing in response to trauma. It’s like I’m shivering, but I’m not cold. Of course, this was the moment that started up. My therapist had informed me years earlier that it was a somewhat normal trauma response. It hadn’t happened in years, so I wasn’t expecting it to start. I couldn’t get away from Adrik fast enough and he felt my legs shaking.
“Are you cold, solnishko? I can get you my jacket,” he said, his hands running up my arms to cover my bare skin.
“No, it’s…I’m fine,” I said as I hopped off the table. “I should get back to work. Thank you for helping me.” I folded my arms under my chest and walked out of the kitchen without looking back.
The past always has a way of showing up at the most inopportune times.
</pre><h1><b>CHAPTER FOUR</b></h1>
<h3>Sephie</h3>
<pre>
When I walked back into the meeting room, it was completely empty. Everyone had vanished. I can’t say I was disappointed by this development. I busied myself with gathering up the empty glasses and the few plates I hadn’t managed to clear already to take them to the kitchen. I hear Max whistling as he’s walking down the hallway toward the back room.
“Hey, why did everyone leave in such a hurry?” he asked as he walked in and started to help me clear the tables.
“No idea,” I said. I kept my gaze down, as I was once again on the verge of tears, trying desperately to keep them in so I wouldn’t cry in front of Max. I hated crying in front of people.
“That was weird. I saw two of those giant bodyguards that came in last take a very drunk guy out front and beat the living sh it out of him, then walk back inside like nothing happened.”
I dropped the glass in my hand and looked at Max, wide-eyed.
“They did what??”
“Yeah, it was comical. And somewhat sad. But mostly comical. I think it was one of the guys you said was always an as*shole to you, so I may or may not have cheered as the bodyguards came back in the restaurant.”
“Max, you have to be careful. You know who these people are.”
“I know, I know, but I was cheering for the Karma that guy was clearly receiving. Hey, wait a minute – what the he ll happened to your arms?? And your neck??”
“This was the reason for the Karma.”
“Holy sh it, Sephie! Are you okay? What happened? Why didn’t you come get me?”
“I’m fine. That guy is always handsy, but he took it to a new level tonight. I might’ve provoked him slightly and made things worse, so he choked me.”
“No, no, no. Don’t you do that. Don’t you take any of the blame on yourself. That guy is a di ck and he had every b*ow to the face he got tonight coming for putting his hands on you.”
“Yeah. I guess you’re right. I just want to close up so I can go home. I’m really tired.”
“Why don’t you just go? I’ll close everything up.”
“You know I’m not going to leave you here by yourself, Max. You might be a big, strong guy, but that’s still a jerk move. Everyone else is gone already.”
“You’re so stubborn you’d argue with the devil himself.”
“True story.”
Max just shook his head and laughed as he grabbed the last glass off the table and headed to the kitchen.
We quickly got everything cleaned up, put away, and ready for tomorrow’s lunch shift. We’d both been working at the restaurant for a few years now, so we had a routine down and worked together seamlessly. It always took us less time than everyone else to get our list of chores done in the restaurant before closing. We usually laughed and picked at each other during the whole process, so time passed quickly.
We walked out of the back door around 1 am. I stood and waited while he locked the back door, then we walked to our cars together. I was so busy looking at the still cloudy sky that I hadn’t noticed the black SUV parked between Max’s car and my car. I stopped dead in my tracks.
Max hadn’t noticed it yet, as he was looking at his phone. Probably texting whatever girl he was planning on hooking up with that night. He walked a few steps ahead of me, then noticed I was no longer beside him.
“Hey…. wha….” he said as he turned to find me frozen in place, a look of horror on my face as I was hoping the person in that SUV was not who I thought it was. Max looked at my face and then spun around to see the SUV parked between our cars. “Ohhhhh sh it,” he said as he took a couple of steps back toward me. Without looking, he pushed me directly behind him as he watched the back door open.
I couldn’t see over Max’s shoulder and I was too scared to peek around him.
“What do you want?” Max yelled. I could feel him trying to be brave for me, but I could also feel how every muscle in his back was tense and rock hard.
“Please, don’t be scared. I only wish to pay Persephone for her excellent service tonight,” a deep and very calm voice said, his Russian accent evident. I recognized that voice. I peeked around Max’s shoulder and sure enough, Mr. Lord King Boss Adrik was walking slowly toward us.
I put my hand on Max’s back and said, “it’s okay, Max. He helped when…you know, Karma. It was his bodyguards.” Max visibly relaxed and inhaled deeply.
“Oh, thank God, I’m not gonna di e tonight,” he said under his breath.
I giggled and reached up and kissed his cheek. “Thank you.”
“You know I got you, gingersnap.”
I walked toward my car and Adrik, who was watching me intently.
“Have you been waiting this whole time? You could’ve just come back into the restaurant. Or dropped it off tomorrow.”
“I had business to take care of. We dr ove back by and your cars were still here, so we waited. It wasn’t long,” he said as he handed me a f at stack of cash.
“Wha…noooo. This is too much. I can’t accept this,” I said, trying to hand the stack of hundred-dollar bills back to him.
“Please. You earned it,” he said as he once again gently grabbed my chin and tilted my head back so he could see my now darker bruise on my neck.
I could hear him curse under his breath but didn’t quite catch what he said as he inspected my bruise.
“It’s okay, really. I’m fine. I’ve had worse, honestly.”
His eyebrows furrowed into a frown as he scanned my face, once more tucking a loose curl behind my ear. Without realizing it, I leaned into his touch. My eyes closed and I took a deep breath. Just like when we were in the kitchen, I had a moment of complete peace. He placed his palm against my cheek, his thumb lightly caressing my face. I relished in the feeling, in the quiet, in the warmth that I felt in my entire body any time he touched me.
“Are you okay to drive home, solnishko?” His question broke me from my trance, and I momentarily forgot where I was.
“What? Oh. Yes. Yes, I’m fine. Sorry,” I said, quickly looking down at my bag to dig my keys out.
“No need to apologize. I think you need more of that in your life,” he said with that se xy smirk back on his face. If he only knew how correct he actually was…
